summary: Daily USD/RUB and USD/VND rates from the central banks, MOEX and the Moscow bank panel, newest row first.

## For future agent

Rolling history for [[Projects/Currency rates]]: what one USD costs in RUB and what one USD
costs in VND, so the two sides of Mai's RUB -> USD -> VND route can be compared day by day.
One row per calendar day, newest first, maintained by `/opt/data/scripts/currency_rates.py`;
the full JSON series (including the fields this table does not show, e.g. the market mid and
the CBR cross) sits outside the vault at `/opt/data/cache/currency-rates/history.json`.

**Columns of the market table.** `CBR` = Bank of Russia official rate for USD. `MOEX` = last
USD/RUB TOM trade on the Moscow Exchange. `Banks buy USD` = cheapest price at which a dollar
can be bought in cash at the tracked Moscow banks (RUB per USD; what Mai would pay). `Banks
sell USD` = best price at which a dollar can be sold to those banks. `VCB transfer` = Vietcombank
transfer rate in VND per USD. A value of `n/a` means the source did not answer that day - it is
never estimated.
